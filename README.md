# WiiSOAP
WiiSOAP is a server designed specifically to handle Wii Shop Channel SOAP - more specifically, that of the ECommerce library.
Ideally, one day this will become feature complete enough to handle other titles utilizing EC, such as DLCs or other purchases.

It aims to implement everything necessary to provide title tickets, manage authentication, and everything between.

This repository has been modified to meet the requirements for WiiMart. This includes functions to handle gifted titles (sending and receiving), handling points (addition and removal), a new database schema to support this, and more.
